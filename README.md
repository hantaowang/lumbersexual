This gem generates random-enough syslog entries for the purposes of testing syslog throughput, aggregated logging infrastructures and log index performance.

## Requirements

Whilst `lumbersexual` will run correctly under MRI 2.3.0 the best performance at scale can be obtained by using jruby-9.0.5.0 or later under Java 7. Furthermore throughput is greatest and most accurate with machines with 2 cores or more. By default twice as many threads as cores will be used.

A dictionary file is needed from which to generate the randomized messages. Under Debian-derived distributions `apt-get install wamerican` is not a bad place to start.

## Usage

```bash
$ lumbersexual --help
```

## Telemetry
By supplying the switch `--statsdhost` with a hostname you can turn on statsd metric generation. Lumbersexual will assume it can write to a statsd-like daemon on UDP 8125 and will supply 2 types of telemetry.

* During a run each thread will increment a counter at the path 
```
lumbersexual.thread.<UUID>.<facility>.<priority>.messages_sent 
```
(where UUID is a randomized string for each thread) each time a message is successfully sent. The facility and priority are reported in their numeric form to save the overhead of a lookup for each write.
* At the end of a run the following metric paths will be produced:
```
lumbersexual.run.messages_total # gauge
lumbersexual.run.elapsed        # timer
lumbersexual.run.rate           # gauge
```

It is up to you to use the aggregation functions of your telemetry system to combine these into a form you find acceptable.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. Run `bundle exec lumbersexual` to use the gem in this directory, ignoring other installed copies of this gem.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
